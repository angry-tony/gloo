### Simple Installation

#### What you'll need

1. OpenShift v3.7+ or higher deployed. We recommend using [minishift](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/using/index.html) to get a cluster up quickly.
1. [`oc`](https://docs.openshift.com/online/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html) installed on your local machine.

Once your OpenShift cluster is up and running, run the following command to deploy Gloo and Envoy to the `gloo-system` namespace:

```bash
oc apply \
  --filename https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solo-io/gloo/master/install/openshift/install.yaml
```

Check that the Gloo pods and services have been created:

```bash
oc project gloo-system
oc get all
